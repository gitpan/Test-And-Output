Revision history for Test-And-Output

v0.001_001 2012-04-09 10:44:16 America/Los_Angeles

Initial Release

v0.001_003 2012-04-09 14:56:26 America/Los_Angeles

Fixed a few incorrectly named Smart::Comments variables

v0.003_001 2012-04-13 08:31:32 America/Los_Angeles

A complete rewrite of the guts since I got frustrated 
troubleshooting the issues associated with some filehandle 
miss-handling.

I also removed the dies_ok method from my module since I 
couldn't figure out how to pass code back an forth without 
having it execute before it was inside the eval block.


v0.003_003 2012-04-14 23:29:02 America/Los_Angeles

Simplified the description and finished running tests with 
the updated guts for Data::Walk::Extracted.
